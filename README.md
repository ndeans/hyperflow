8/3/24 : Buffers and Engines

I basically rewrote the code. Last time my focus on primarily on the generic node. But complexity arose quickly and 
soon I didn't know what the hell...  Nodes, were too complex to start with. An assembly of structures. 
This time, I am more focused on elemental entities and a flat static veil (registry) for heads up views.
